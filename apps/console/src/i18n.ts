/**
 * Every user-visible string in the console, in one place.
 *
 * The app is English-only in M0, but no component holds a literal: strings live here so a locale
 * layer can be dropped in without touching a template, and so the vocabulary stays consistent —
 * "agent" is always an agent, "grant" always a grant, and an action keeps the same name from the
 * button that starts it to the toast that confirms it.
 *
 * Interpolation uses `{name}` placeholders resolved by `t()`.
