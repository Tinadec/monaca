 * Routes.

 * The interaction id arrives in the query string (`?tenant=…&interaction=int_…`), exactly as the
 * authorize endpoint builds it (§6.1). The path form is also registered so a future move to
 * `/sign-in/{tenant}/{iid}` is a server-side change only — the page reads either.
 *
 * Everything else lands on the sign-in page, because a hosted sign-in origin has no other job. A
 * stray visit with no interaction id gets the page's own explanation rather than a 404, which is the
 * friendlier failure for a URL a person may have bookmarked or been handed.
